# monty-python-holy-grail-rpg
 An RPG using original artwork for Monty Python's holy grail
 ver 0.1
 
 This game is a fan fiction RPG to celebrate the Monty Python's holy grail movie. 
 This version contains only the prelude and the artwork display of the heroes and the lady of the lake.
 Future versions will introduce the obstacles and the storyline.
 
 The aim of the game would be:
 - Ver 1.0: Chosen the hero, you should fall for the same enemy in the same way as in the movie. 
 If you did so, you win.
 - Ver 2.0: My own additional components that will borrow from other monty python aspects, 
 including Life of Brian and the sketches.
